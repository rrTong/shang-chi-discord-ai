LI, 十环的传说已经流传了上千年。
LI, 不论这个故事如何演变。
LI, 它的主人公永远都是同一个人。
LI, 有人说他的十环是火山口里捡来的 还有人说是墓穴里盗来的。
LI, 它们给了他神一般的力量，也赋予了他长生不老的魔法。
LI, 他本可借着十环之力来惩恶扬善。
LI, 但他想要的... 只有征服。
LI, 他造了一支十环军团。
LI, 千百年来 他们扫荡了世界的每个角落。
LI, 他们潜伏于暗中...
LI, 颠覆各方政权...
LI, 也改写了历史。
LI, 凭借着士环之力他早已称霸天下。
LI, 但他却还不满足。
WENWU, 你听说过大罗的传说吗？
WENWU, 一个隐世的村庄 在那里 神奇的功法代代相传。
WENWU, 传说中的神兽和古老的法术还都存在。
WENWU, 我要找到这个地方。
CHANCELLOR HUI, 明白。我这就派侦查队去一探究竟，然后有消息立马跟你汇报。
WENWU, 我们现在就去。
CHANCELLOR HUI, 这竹林... 好像在动。
LI, 这世上再也没有可以让他征服的地方了。
LI, 于是他找上了我的家乡。
WENWU, 大罗入口在哪？
LI, 我们村庄不欢迎你。
WENWU, 你好像不知道我是谁。
LI, 我不管你是谁。
LI, 走吧，不要自找麻烦。
LI, 就这点本事？
LI, 那是我第一次见到你的父亲。
LI, 我从没想过自己会为他动心。
LI, 但爱总是自有安排。
LI, 尚气，十环的传说讲都讲不完，等你长大了自然就会了解到。
SHANG-CHI, 可爸爸的十环那么厉害，你是怎么打败他的？
LI, 妈妈的故乡大罗有一个神龙，它是我们的保护神。
LI, 等你领悟了神龙之心，你就可以做很多了不起的事情。
SHANG-CHI, 那你现在还有魔法吗？
LI, 妈妈离开的时候把魔法还给了神龙，但是妈妈得到的更宝贵。
LI, 这个给你。
LI, 如果有一天你迷路了，它会帮你找到回家的路。
LI, 记住了吗？
SHANG-CHI, Okay.
SHANG-CHI," Hello, sir, welcome to the Fairmont…"
KATY, I’m driving.
SHANG-CHI," No, you’re not… Katy."
SHANG-CHI," Hey, hey, get back here."
SHANG-CHI, Give me the key.
SHANG-CHI, (SIGHS) Please open the door.
KATY," Oh, my God."
SHANG-CHI, Get out.
KATY, You get in!
SHANG-CHI," Look, if happens to this thing, we’re gonna be jobless and in debt for the rest of our lives."
KATY," Oh, come on. Nothing’s gonna happen to this car."
KATY, I’m the Asian Jeff Gordon.
SHANG-CHI, I don’t know who that is.
KATY, Most career wins in all of NASCAR history?
SHANG-CHI, Please get out of the car.
KATY," Shaun, we’ve been friends for 10 years, okay?"
KATY, You know I’m not an idiot.
KATY," Please, get in. I’ll go slow."
SHANG-CHI," (GASPS) Katy, watch the…"
SHANG-CHI, I knew Katy was trouble the first day we met in high school.
SHANG-CHI," I was getting picked on a lot, for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot."
SHANG-CHI," Plus, I had just moved to the US, so I was struggling with my English, and I was on my way to lunch one day when this guy who was like twice my size yells at me from down the hall, “What’s up, Gangnam Style?”"
SHANG-CHI," So I yelled back, “I’m not Korean, idiot.”"
KATY," And I turn the corner, and I see this guy drop his backpack, he’s getting all up in his face…"
SHANG-CHI," And right before he was about to throw the first punch,"
SHANG-CHI," Katy comes out of nowhere, steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics to Hotel California."
JOHN, What?
KATY, It’s the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people.
SHANG-CHI, And that’s how we met.
KATY, Then I pulled him into the parking lot…
SHANG-CHI, At which point she revealed that she had also swiped the keys to the guy’s Mustang.
KATY," Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block."
KATY," And your wife was in the car, too."
SHANG-CHI, That’s true. You were.
JOHN, What?
SOO, I was just in the back seat.
KATY, That’s a part of the car.
SHANG-CHI, That’s still a part of the car.
JOHN, How have you never told me this story?
KATY," You know, before she was a lawyer,"
KATY, your girl was pretty wild.
JOHN, Oh! What happened?
SOO, I grew up.
KATY, What’s that supposed to mean?
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, what’s that supposed to mean?"
SOO, That maybe there’s a point
SOO, where you’re supposed to stop going on joyrides and start thinking about living up to your potential.
KATY," Please tell me you’re kidding, Soo."
SOO," Look, we’re now living in a world where at any moment half the population can just disappear."
SOO, Life’s too short and too fragile.
SOO," Katy, you’re a valet driver with an honours degree from Berkeley, and Shaun can speak, like, four languages."
SOO, You’ve always been the most talented people I know.
SOO, I just don’t get why you’re scared
SOO, to actually use it for something serious.
SHANG-CHI, Wow.
KATY," You sound like my mom. You also… dress like her a little bit, too."
KATY," Where’s this from, Talbots?"
KATY, We’re not running from adulthood.
KATY, How is it running to have jobs that you actually like?
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, that doesn’t even make any sense."
KATY, (FUMBLES) Did you think valet parking is easy?
SHANG-CHI, It’s like the most challenging job ever.
SHANG-CHI," You need people skills, driving skills…"
KATY, Soo can’t even parallel park.
SHANG-CHI," Well, it’s almost midnight. We got the early shift."
SHANG-CHI," Should probably be responsible, go to sleep."
KATY," Yeah, we can be responsible. We can do that."

SHANG-CHI," Morning, Mrs Chen."
MRS CHEN, She’s not ready yet.
MRS CHEN, Come have some joe while you wait.
MRS CHEN," Katy, Shaun’s here."
KATY," Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute."
MRS CHEN," Ruihua, you’re supposed to be helping your dad stock the shop."
RUIHUA," Mom, I can’t work on an empty stomach, my legs get crampy."
RUIHUA, Maybe Shaun can help him instead of just showing up every day to eat our food.
SHANG-CHI, I’m happy to help.
MRS CHEN," No, it’s Ruihua’s job, let him do it."
SHANG-CHI, Waipo.
WAIPO, 这是外公的座位
SHANG-CHI," Oh, sorry."
WAIPO, He’s getting all his favourite things this year for the Day of the Dead.
SHANG-CHI, Are you sure that Waigong’s allowed to take
SHANG-CHI, Funyuns and cigarettes back to the afterlife?
WAIPO, He can take anything.
WAIPO, Last year I put a bottle of whisky on his grave…
WAIPO, And it was gone the next morning.
WAIPO, I know you kids think it’s silly.
KATY,"  We don’t think it’s silly, Waipo."
KATY, We just know Waigong would’ve wanted you to move on and enjoy your life.
MRS CHEN, “Moving on” is an American idea.
KATY," You’re American, Mom! Don’t forget."
MRS CHEN," Shaun, did my daughter apply to any new jobs this week?"
SHANG-CHI, She really likes her job.
SHANG-CHI, We both do.
KATY, Mm-hmm.
MRS CHEN, Waigong didn’t move here from Hunan so you could park cars for a living.
KATY," Well, on that note, I think we’re gonna miss our bus."
SHANG-CHI, Mm.
KATY, I’m sorry for my unacceptable job.
KATY," And for staying out late last night, trying to enjoy my life."
KATY," But one day, I’ll make you proud, I promise."
RUIHUA," I’m proud of you, sis."
RUIHUA, Parking cars is super hard.
KATY," Thanks, bro."
KATY," Maybe one day you’ll pass your driver’s test, live the dream like me."
KATY," Come on, Shaun, let’s go."
SHANG-CHI, 走了，外婆。
WAIPO, 你们什么时候结婚？
SHANG-CHI, 外婆我们只是朋友。
WAIPO, 好了。走，走。
KATY, Look. Look at that. Look at that girl.
KATY, She’s writing a research paper on a bus.
SHANG-CHI, So?
KATY, That is exactly the daughter my mom wishes came out of her vagina.
SHANG-CHI, I’m sorry about her.
SHANG-CHI, How’s it goin’?
GANG MEMBER, 项链给我，就没有人会受伤。
KATY, Do you know this guy?
SHANG-CHI," I don’t know what you’re talking about, dude."
SHANG-CHI, Hey! Get off of me!
KATY, Whoa.
KATY," What is wrong with you, asshole?"
SHANG-CHI, 我不想惹麻烦。
GANG MEMBER, 那就把项链交出来！
KATY, You have the wrong guy!
KATY, Does he look like he can fight?
KATY," Come on, bro! (GRUNTS)"
SHANG-CHI, You okay?
KLEV," Yo, what up, y’all? It’s your boy Klev, comin’ at you live on the bus."
KLEV," I actually did take a little bit of martial arts as a youth, so I’m gonna try and grade this fight as we’re goin’."
KATY, Holy shit.
KATY, Who are you?
KLEV," You got this, bro!"
KLEV, My bad.
YUCHEN," No, no, no!"
SHANG-CHI, Sorry.
KATY, What the hell’s going on?
SHANG-CHI, You really wanna talk about this now?
KLEV, Bus driver is down.
KLEV, I’m not gonna handle this.
KLEV," Every time I’ve tried to drive a bus, I get yelled at."
KATY," Go, you freak!"
SHANG-CHI," Open the door, please!"
SHANG-CHI, The back is about to go.
SHANG-CHI," On my signal, make a hard right."
KATY, What signal?
SHANG-CHI, Everybody to the front now!
WOMAN," Go! Go, go, go."
KLEV," What’s up, y’all? What’s up, y’all? What’s up, y’all?"
RAZOR FIST, You and your sister deserve what’s coming.
KATY," Hold on, everybody!"
SHANG-CHI," Oh, God."
KATY," Oh, my God!"
KATY, Sorry. Heh.
KATY, We make a good team.
KATY, Shaun. Hey.
KATY, You need to tell me what the hell’s going on.
KATY, What are you doing? Where are you going?
SHANG-CHI, Macau.
KATY, Macau?
SHANG-CHI," Those guys are going after my sister next, and I have to get to her first."
KATY, You have a sister?
SHANG-CHI," Look, I know this is confusing."
SHANG-CHI," I’ll explain it when I get back, I promise."
KATY," No, no."
KATY," Hell no, dude."
KATY, This is bullshit!
KATY, I have been by your side for half your life.
KATY," I get there are things you never wanted to talk about, and I never wanted to push."
KATY," But a guy with a freaking machete for an arm just chopped our bus in half, Shaun!"
KATY, Who the hell are you?
SHANG-CHI, My sister sent me this a few months ago.
SHANG-CHI, I think it’s the address of where she’s staying.
SHANG-CHI, Those guys back there were sent by my dad.
KATY, What?
SHANG-CHI, If they hurt her…
SHANG-CHI," I’m sorry, but I have to go."
KATY, Fine.
KATY, You can explain on the plane.
SHANG-CHI," What? No, Katy, you can’t just…"
KATY," You can explain on the plane, Shaun!"
SHANG-CHI, After my mom died… my dad started my training.
SHANG-CHI," From sunup to sundown, I was taught every possible way to kill a man."
SHANG-CHI," By the time I was 14, I could barely remember what life was like before she died."
SHANG-CHI, That’s how old I was when he sent me on my first assignment.
SHANG-CHI, I was willing to do anything he wanted.
SHANG-CHI," If he asked me to burn the world down, I would’ve asked him…"
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, Beef or vegetarian?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT," We’re all out of the chicken, so I can only offer you beef or vegetarian?"
BOTH, Um…
KATY, Vegetarian would be great.
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, same."
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, Okay.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, Thank you.
KATY, So…
FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Oh, we’re out of the vegetarian too."
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, Now we only have beef.
KATY," Beef. ‘Cause that’s all you have, right?"
FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Okay, you’ll have the beef."
KATY, Yes.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, And…
SHANG-CHI, Beef.
KATY, And the beef.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT, Two beefs.
KATY, Did you go through with it?
SHANG-CHI," I knew that I couldn’t go back to him, so I just… ran."
SHANG-CHI, I know this is a lot to dump on you.
KATY, I’m sorry about your mom.
SHANG-CHI, I should also probably mention that my name’s not technically Shaun.
KATY, What?
KATY, What is it?
SHANG-CHI, It’s Shang-Chi.
KATY, Shaun-Chi.
SHANG-CHI, No. Shang-Chi.
KATY, Shaun-Chi.
SHANG-CHI, Shang.
KATY, Shaun.
SHANG-CHI, Shang.
KATY, Shan.
SHANG-CHI, S-H-A-N-G. Shang.
KATY, Shang?
SHANG-CHI, Yeah.
KATY, You changed your name from Shang to Shaun?
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, I don’t… Yeah."
KATY, I wonder how your father found you.
SHANG-CHI," Okay, I was 15 years old. All right?"
KATY, What is your name change logic?
KATY, You’re going into hiding.
SHANG-CHI, Okay.
KATY," And your name is Michael, you go on and change it to Mishael."
SHANG-CHI, That’s not what happened.
KATY," It’s like, “Hi, my name’s Gina."
KATY, “I’m gonna go into hiding. My new name’s Gina.”
SHANG-CHI, (MOUTHING) Can’t hear you. I’m sorry.
KATY," Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, you can hear me."
CHINESE BOUNCER, 签字。
SHANG-CHI, 我在找我妹，徐夏灵。
SHANG-CHI, 你听说过她吗？
SHANG-CHI, 这里是她给我的地址。
SHANG-CHI, Okay.
KATY, Seems like a nice fella.
KATY, And this elevator is definitely up to code.
KATY, There’s absolutely no chance of it just falling off the side of the building…
JON JON, Bus Boy!
SHANG-CHI, Uh…
JON JON, 我靠，你三天就有200万浏览量！
KATY," Damn, dude."
SHANG-CHI," Oh, no."
JON JON, 司机来了！
KATY," (IN ENGLISH) Oh, my Chinese sucks."
JON JON," Oh, all good."
JON JON, I speak A-B-C.
KATY," Oh, great."
JON JON, I’m Jon Jon.
KATY, Jon Jon.
JON JON, Welcome to the Golden Daggers Club.
JON JON," (SIGHS) Okay, let’s get you ready to fight."
SHANG-CHI, Wait. What?
JON JON, We’re a multi-platform global operation.
JON JON, Every fight livestreamed on the dark web.
JON JON, Thousands of viewers placing bets as we speak.
JON JON, This is gonna take your brand to a whole new level.
SHANG-CHI, Think there’s been some sort of confusion.
KATY, I like your spike face.
SPIKE FACE, Thanks!
JON JON," Usually, you gotta fight your way to centre ring, but a viral star like you?"
JON JON," Front of line, baby."
SHANG-CHI, I’m not here to fight anybody. Okay?
SHANG-CHI," I’m looking for my sister, Xu Xialing."
JON JON, Never heard of her.
JON JON," We just lost a fighter at the last minute, so you get the next slot."
JON JON," Nice one, Helen."
KATY, Is he gonna be fighting in one of these?
JON JON," Oh, no, no, no. These are like low-level fights."
JON JON, You’re gonna be fighting up there.
WONG," That hurt, Emil."
WONG, You want me to show you how it feels?
CROWD, (CHANTING) Wong! Wong! Wong!
CROWD, Wong! Wong! Wong!
JON JON," Go, Wong!"
JON JON, I always bet on Asian.
KATY," Oh, my God."
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, look, I’m not going up there, okay?"
SHANG-CHI, I’m just trying to…
JON JON," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
JON JON, It’s too late to back out now.
JON JON," You already committed, bro."
SHANG-CHI, What?
JON JON," You signed the contract, remember?"
JON JON, Your name’s on the roster.
JON JON, The bets are piling in.
KATY, Really? What’s our cut?
JON JON," Oh, it’s huge."
SHANG-CHI, It doesn’t matter.
KATY, It matters.
JON JON," Dude, I saw you fight five assassins and a giant Romanian with a razor for an arm on a moving bus."
JON JON, This is just one guy.
JON JON," Just do it. Then we all get paid, and then I’ll help you find whoever you’re looking for."
KATY, Come on. You got this.
JON JON, You got this.
KATY, Don’t be nervous.
SHANG-CHI, Thank you.
KATY, Yeah.
SHANG-CHI, Yeah.
WONG, How’s the jaw?
WONG, Maybe you’ll start controlling those punches like we practised?
JON JON, Love that guy.
JON JON, Now take your shirt off.
JON JON," Ladies and gentlemen, the fight we’ve all been waiting for."
JON JON," The incredible viral sensation, all the way from San Francisco, USA, it’s Bus Boy!"
KATY, What happened to your shirt?
JON JON," And his opponent for tonight, it’s Macau’s own fearsome killer…"
JON JON, Xu Xialing!
SHANG-CHI, 妹妹。
SHANG-CHI," Wait, wait!"
SHANG-CHI, 你怎么了你？
SHANG-CHI, 我知道你在生我的气。
SHANG-CHI, 但是我有急事和你说？
SHANG-CHI, 我们没有时间打。
JON JON," Ooh, that’s gotta hurt."
SHANG-CHI, 你能不能不打我？
SHANG-CHI, 住手!我是来帮你的!
SHANG-CHI, 爸要来找你。
SHANG-CHI, 我不会再跟你打。
XIALING, 你不应该回来。
XIALING, 有的时候我在练功...
XIALING, 我闭上我的眼睛。
XIALING, 我感觉她就在我身后？
SHANG-CHI, 你有。
XIALING, I know what you’re going there to do.
XIALING," I don’t know what he’s telling you, but Mom…"
SHANG-CHI, Mom’s dead.
XIALING, 不要把我扔在这。
SHANG-CHI, 灵灵，我三天以后就回来。
JON JON," (IN ENGLISH) Xu Xialing, you’re amazing!"
JON JON," We love you, Xu Xialing! Whoo!"
SHANG-CHI, 这地方归你管？
XIALING, 这地方归我。
SHANG-CHI, Where’d you get all that money?
SHANG-CHI, Did you bet against me?
KATY, No.
KATY," Hi, Xialing. I’m Katy."
KATY," You’re, like, such a badass."
KATY," Everything that you do is, like, so cool."
KATY, That was really cool.
XIALING, I like your pants.
KATY, Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.
XIALING, What do you want?
SHANG-CHI, The Ten Rings ambushed us in San Francisco.
XIALING, I saw the video.
SHANG-CHI, They took my pendant.
SHANG-CHI, They’re gonna come for yours next.
SHANG-CHI," I don’t know what he wants with them, but we both know it can’t be good."
XIALING, You know what he said to me when he left?
XIALING, “I’ll be back in three days.”
XIALING," And after three days, I went to our mom’s shrine and waited."
XIALING," Three days turned into a week, a week turned to a month, and a month turned to six years."
XIALING, That’s how long it took me to realise I didn’t need him any more.
XIALING, I built this place on my own.
XIALING," I didn’t need you then, and I don’t need you now."
SHANG-CHI, Then why would you send me the postcard?
XIALING, What postcard?
XIALING, I didn’t send you this.
SHANG-CHI, Is there a back exit?
KATY, Shaun.
SHANG-CHI," Hey. Hey! Hey, open up!"
KATY," She’s gone, dude."
KATY, What do we do?
KATY, What do we do?
SHANG-CHI, Uh…
SHANG-CHI, Come on!
KATY," Oh, hell no. Screw you! I’m not doing this."
SHANG-CHI," If we make it to the elevator, we can hop in on the next floor."
SHANG-CHI," Katy, we’re out of options. We have to go now."
SHANG-CHI," One, two, three."
KATY, Whoa.
SHANG-CHI, Just head straight for that elevator.
SHANG-CHI, You got this.
SHANG-CHI, I’ll buy you some time. Just keep going.

SHANG-CHI, (STRAINING) Gotcha.
KATY, Shaun!
SHANG-CHI, Katy!

XIALING, 现在你知道什么滋味了。
SHANG-CHI, What does he want with the pendant…
XIALING, Did America make you soft?
XIALING, He has the pendant!
WENWU, I told my men they wouldn’t be able to kill you if they tried.
WENWU, Glad I was right.
WENWU, 我很想你。
WENWU, Let’s go home.
WENWU, My son is home.
WENWU, Take the girls to their room.
KATY," I’ve seen some really scary stuff this week, but your dad’s on, like, a whole ‘nother level."
KATY, Is he gonna kill us?
XIALING, Just nod. Don’t talk. He’ll forget you’re there.
XIALING, That’s how I survived.
KATY, He always treat you like that?
XIALING, Only after my mom died.
XIALING, He said he couldn’t look at me because I reminded him of her.
XIALING, I wasn’t allowed to train with the boys.
XIALING, But I watched everything they did and taught myself to do it better.
KATY, When did you leave?
XIALING, I ran away when I was 16.
XIALING, As soon as I knew my brother wasn’t coming back.
KATY, You started an underground fight ring in Macau when you were 16 years old?
XIALING," If my dad won’t let me into his empire, I’m gonna build my own."
KATY, Hell yeah.
WENWU, Shang-Chi.
WENWU, 可以了。
WENWU, Have you been practicing your English?
SHANG-CHI, Yes.
WENWU, You have to strengthen your mind along with your body.
WENWU," If you want them to be yours one day, you have to show me you’re strong enough to carry them."
SHANG-CHI, How did you find me?
WENWU, I always know where my children are.
WENWU," I gave you 10 years to live your life, and where did it get you?"
WENWU, Now it’s time for you to take your place by my side.
SHANG-CHI, That’s not gonna happen.
WENWU, American girl.
SHANG-CHI, Her name is Katy.
WENWU, What is your Chinese name?
KATY, Ruiwen.
WENWU," Names are sacred, Ruiwen."
WENWU," They connect us not only to ourselves, but to everyone who came before."
WENWU, A funny story.
WENWU," Some years ago, a terrorist from America needed a boogeyman to bring your country to its knees."
WENWU," So, he appropriated The Ten Rings."
WENWU, My Ten Rings.
WENWU," But because he didn’t know my actual name, he invented a new one."
WENWU, Do you know the name he chose?
WENWU, The Mandarin.
WENWU, He gave his figurehead the name of a chicken dish.
WENWU, And it worked.
WENWU, America was terrified.
WENWU, Of an orange.
WENWU," The truth is, I’ve had many names throughout my life."
WENWU," The Warrior King, Master Khan, the most dangerous man on Earth."
WENWU," For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be."
WENWU," But when I met their mother, everything changed."
WENWU, She showed me a part of myself I didn’t know was there.
WENWU, It was like I was seeing the world for the first time.
WENWU, She gave up everything so we could be together.
WENWU, And so did I.
LI, 这是谁呀?
LI, 说『你好妹妹!』
WENWU," After all those years, I finally found something worth growing old for."
WENWU, My real name is Wenwu.
WENWU, She was the only one who called me that.
WENWU, And when she died… I was lost for many years.
WENWU, But I’m not lost any more.
WENWU," When you children ran away, I was so desperate to connect with your mother, I threw myself back into the studies of her village."
WENWU, The legendary Ta Lo.
WENWU," I wasn’t able to find the secret path to the village entrance, but I did find what they are hiding."
WENWU, There’s a gate deep in their mountains.
WENWU, Your mother is waiting for us there.
WENWU, I know this is a lot.
WENWU, I might not have believed it if she didn’t tell me herself.
XIALING, What are you talking about?
WENWU," I was sitting right here in this seat, deep in my research… and she spoke to me."
WENWU, It was like she was standing in this room.
WENWU, I could feel her breath on my cheek and her hand on my back.
WENWU, She told me she needs my help.
SHANG-CHI, To do what?
WENWU, To save her from her people.
WENWU," After we fell in love, your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo."
WENWU," She asked permission from the elders, and they refused."
WENWU, They said I wasn’t worthy.
WENWU, She would still be with us.
WENWU, We would all be living there together.
WENWU, Ta Lo did this to us.
WENWU, They locked her behind that gate to punish her.
WENWU, Don’t you see?
WENWU, She’s leaving clues for us.
WENWU," She wants us to find her and bring her home, so we can be a family again."
SHANG-CHI," Dad, Mom’s gone."
SHANG-CHI," She’s not talking to you from behind a gate, and she’s not leaving any clues for us."
WENWU, Then what are these?
WENWU, The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze.
WENWU, But there’s a direct path through the forest that only opens once a year on Qingming Jie.
WENWU," To get through, you need to know the route and the exact time it opens."
WENWU, Now I know both.
WENWU," Three days from now, we will rescue my wife from her prison and bring her home."
WENWU, This is why you’re here.
WENWU, To help me bring her back to us.
XIALING, And what happens if they don’t let you open the gate?
WENWU, We’ll burn the village to the ground.
SHANG-CHI, What?
SHANG-CHI, You can’t just march into our mom’s village with this bullshit.
SHANG-CHI," I mean, do you have any idea how insane…"
KATY, Hey!
KATY,Where are you taking me?
WENWU, 你还要装多久？
WENWU, Lock them up.
LI, 没关系。
LI, 咱们一家人很快就能在一起了。
KATY," So, um, pretty confused right now, because, uh, initially I thought your dad should definitely see a therapist for his delusions, but then that dragon vomited a magical water map, and now I have no idea what’s real."
KATY, Is what he said about your mom’s village true?
SHANG-CHI, She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo when we were kids.
SHANG-CHI, A village in another dimension full of magical creatures.
SHANG-CHI, I thought it was just a fairy tale.
XIALING, What if Dad’s right?
SHANG-CHI, About Mom being locked behind a gate by her own people?
XIALING, Crazier things have turned out to be true.
SHANG-CHI," Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but if we don’t find a way to get to Ta Lo before him, he’s gonna destroy everything that’s left of our family."
XIALING, This family was destroyed a long time ago.
SHANG-CHI, The hell was that?
TREVOR, Oh.
KATY, (FUMBLES) You’re going toward that noise?
TREVOR, “Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
TREVOR," “Oh, I would’st though could’st."
TREVOR, “My deed ’twere best not…”
TREVOR," Oh, hello, loves."
TREVOR, What year is it?
KATY, Who are you?
TREVOR, Trevor? Slattery?
TREVOR, The actor from Liverpool?
TREVOR, Wait.
TREVOR, Are you the governor’s kids?
TREVOR, I’ve been preparing a monologue for your homecoming dinner.
TREVOR, Oh. Where’s she going?
KATY, Why are you down here?
TREVOR," Well, some time ago, I was offered the role of a terrorist."
TREVOR," I know, facile, trite, I couldn’t agree more."
TREVOR," But times were lean, you know what I mean?"
TREVOR," Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC."
TREVOR," But, ironic twist, it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist, and I wasn’t playing a character at all, but what I now recognise to be a rather unflattering portrait of your father."
TREVOR, We all got our just deserts.
TREVOR," The producer got blown up by Iron Man, and I served time in federal prison, which turned out to be the best thing for me."
TREVOR," I got clean, I rediscovered my passion."
SHANG-CHI, Then my dad broke you out?
TREVOR, Exactly.
SHANG-CHI, To kill you.
TREVOR, Exactly.
TREVOR," But just as his men were tying me up for my execution, I launched into a performance of my Macbeth."
TREVOR, “Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would’st though could’st…”
TREVOR, They couldn’t get enough of it.
TREVOR, I’ve been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since.
KATY, So you’re like his jester?
TREVOR, I can give you a quick preview if you like.
TREVOR," “Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle…”"
SHANG-CHI," Uh, thank you, Trevor. I think we’re okay."
SHANG-CHI," Right now, we really just need to find a way to…"
SHANG-CHI, What the hell?
KATY, What the… Oh!
KATY, Whoa!
SHANG-CHI, What is that?
TREVOR, What’s what?
KATY, That! What is that?
SHANG-CHI, That! That! That!
TREVOR, You can see Morris?
KATY, Morris?
TREVOR, They can see you! You’re real!
TREVOR, All this time I thought I was hallucinating him.
TREVOR," Oh, this is such fab news."
KATY, Where’s his face?
TREVOR, He’s a bit sensitive about that.
TREVOR, Oh. Really?
TREVOR, Morris says he knows who you are.
KATY, It talks… It talks to you?
TREVOR," (CHUCKLES) If he didn’t talk to me, I’d have gone mad yonks ago."
SHANG-CHI, How would he know me?
TREVOR, He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo.
TREVOR," Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest on one of his expeditions to find the entrance."
TREVOR, He wants you to take him home.
SHANG-CHI," Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how."
SHANG-CHI," According to my dad, the path there only opens once a year."
TREVOR, Oh. (CHUCKLES)
TREVOR, Morris says he can guide you there right now.
TREVOR, You can get through the maze without waiting for the path to open.
TREVOR," But, and it’s a big “but,” it’s very dangerous."
KATY, How dangerous?
TREVOR, No one’s ever made it out alive.
TREVOR, But Morris is 90% confident he can guide us through safely.
TREVOR, Oh. (CHUCKLES)
TREVOR, 19%.
KATY," Look, I’ve done dumber things with worse odds."
KATY, But even if that chicken-pig is right…
KATY, …we’re still locked in your…
XIALING, Whew!
SHANG-CHI, How did you…
XIALING, Dad has a tunnel system under the whole compound.
XIALING, That’s how I escaped last time.
KATY, Oh.
XIALING, This will take us straight to the garage.
KATY," Oh, my God."
KATY, I kinda like this guy.
SHANG-CHI, Just head up that ramp and through the front gate.
SHANG-CHI, Should be a straight shot.
SHANG-CHI, Figure we got about 30 seconds until he…
TREVOR, Do you mind?
TREVOR, I get sick in the back. Carsick.
RAZOR FIST, That’s my car!
KATY, God damn it.
KATY, Hold on.
KATY, Is there another exit?
XIALING, The other end of the garage.
XIALING, But we need a fingerprint to open it.
SHANG-CHI, Incoming!
KATY, Shit!
KATY, What’s happening back there?
SHANG-CHI, Doing my best.
AUTOMATED VOICE, Scan hand print for gate access.
KATY, Hurry up!
SHANG-CHI, I’m trying!
KATY, Shaun!
WENWU, They will come back once I bring her home.
WENWU, Prepare the men for war.
RAZOR FIST," Yes, sir."
TREVOR, The first time I witnessed pure artistry.
TREVOR, 1968. Planet of the Apes.
TREVOR," I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum, watching mastery unfold before my very eyes."
TREVOR," After the film, I asked her, “How did they get those monkeys to do those things?”"
TREVOR," And she patted me on the head and she said, “It’s not real, pet. It’s just acting.”"
TREVOR, That’s when I knew.
TREVOR," If they can teach those monkeys to act that brilliantly, just imagine what I could bring to the world."
SHANG-CHI, So you became an actor because you thought the monkeys were actually…
TREVOR, Riding horses? I did. Yes.
TREVOR," When, in fact, they were simply acting as if they were riding horses."
TREVOR," I still can’t get my head round it, to be honest."
KATY," Good for you, dude."
KATY," You found your passion and went for it, and eventually used it to cripple the US government, but whatever."
TREVOR," Yeah. No, yeah, thanks."
SHANG-CHI," Um, this is really cool and all, but how long do we have to sit here?"
TREVOR, Morris is very clear.
TREVOR, The way through is all about timing.
SHANG-CHI," Okay, but how long are we talking?"
SHANG-CHI," Like, hours? Days?"
TREVOR," Friends, I am but a transitory vessel for the infinite wisdom of a creature far more advanced than we’ll ever truly understand."
TREVOR," What he sees, what he feels of this vast, unknown universe is beyond anything our simple brains can…"
TREVOR, Oh. You can go.
KATY, What?
TREVOR, Go. You can go. He says “go.”
TREVOR, You should speed up.
KATY, What? Why?
SHANG-CHI," Katy, go, go, go!"
TREVOR," Morris says, “Hard right on three.”"
KATY, What?
TREVOR, Two…
SHANG-CHI, Hard right where?
TREVOR, Now.
TREVOR, And left.
TREVOR, It’s all about staying in the pocket.
KATY, What pocket?
TREVOR, We’re in it now.
SHANG-CHI, What happens if we don’t stay in the pocket?
TREVOR, The forest eats us.
SHANG-CHI, Eats us? What does that mean?
TREVOR, He says it eats us. Go left.
SHANG-CHI, Watch your back!
TREVOR, Stay in the pocket.
KATY, How close is it?
XIALING, Five metres.
TREVOR, Stay in the pocket.
KATY, What is that in feet?
SHANG-CHI, Really fricking close.
TREVOR, Stay in the pocket.
KATY," Will you just stop saying, “Stay in the pocket”?"
TREVOR," One last right, then straight on to the end."
TREVOR, You might wanna hurry up.
KATY, What do you think I’m doing?
XIALING, We’re not gonna make it.
TREVOR," I’m coming home, Mummy."
TREVOR," Morris says, “Great job, everyone.”"
TREVOR," Now, all we have to do is go through that waterfall, and we’re pretty much there."
TREVOR, Bloody hell.
TREVOR, I think those birds are on fire.
TREVOR, Really? Oh.
TREVOR, Morris says it’s normal.
TREVOR, They’re old mates of his.
TREVOR, That’s a weird horse.
TREVOR, What’s it looking at me for?
SHANG-CHI, 大家好！
SHANG-CHI, 我是徐尚气。
SHANG-CHI, 这是我的妹妹，徐夏灵。
SHANG-CHI, 我们是映丽的孩子。
SHANG-CHI, 这是我的朋友，凯蒂。
GUANG BO, 少说！哪儿来的回哪去！
SHANG-CHI, 你误会了。请听我们说。
SHANG-CHI, Whoa.
YING NAN, 光伯！
YING NAN, 你这是在干什么？
YING NAN, 放下你们的武器！
YING NAN, 尚气。
YING NAN, 夏灵。
YING NAN, 我是你们的小姨映南。
YING NAN, 终于见到你们了。
YING NAN, 你像你的妈妈。
KATY," Hi, I’m Katy."
YING NAN," Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy."
KATY," Oh, thank you."
YING NAN, Look who has found his way home! (CHUCKLES)
TREVOR, I’m not a threat.
TREVOR, Just an entertainer.
TREVOR, Morris can vouch for me.
SHANG-CHI, We don’t have much time.
SHANG-CHI, Our father is coming.
YING NAN," Our people have been here for over 4,000 years, preparing for something we hope will never happen."
YING NAN," We are the keepers of the Dark Gate, sworn to protect this realm and yours from the evil that’s locked behind it."
SHANG-CHI, Our dad is coming here to open that gate.
SHANG-CHI, He thinks you’re holding our mom there.
YING NAN, Why would he think that?
XIALING, She told him.
XIALING, He says he can hear her asking for help.
YING NAN, Is he wearing the rings?
SHANG-CHI, He hasn’t taken them off since she died.
SHANG-CHI, What do they have to do with all this?
YING NAN, The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond the shores of our small village.
YING NAN," We have cities that surpass any in your universe, rich with culture and history."
YING NAN," Thousands of years ago, all of our people lived in peace and prosperity, until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness."
YING NAN," He came with his army, devouring every soul in their path, and with each kill, they grew stronger."
YING NAN," After decimating our largest cities, they were headed to your universe to do the same."
YING NAN, The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here to stop them from reaching the portal to your world.
YING NAN, But our ancestors were no match for them.
YING NAN, Until The Great Protector joined their fight and turned the tide.
YING NAN," Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army into the Dark Gate and locked it behind them."
YING NAN," Our people have guarded that gate ever since, empowered by the magic of The Great Protector and the gift that she gave us."
YING NAN, Dragon scales.
YING NAN, Makes very good armour.
YING NAN, Your father isn’t the first to come here to open the Dark Gate.
YING NAN," Many have tried and failed over the centuries, and they all had one thing in common."
YING NAN, They were lured here by the voice of something on the other side.
YING NAN, A voice that promised them their greatest desires.
SHANG-CHI, So you think soul eaters are talking to our dad?
YING NAN, They know The Ten Rings have the power to break them free.
KATY, Oh.
KATY, Here you go.
KATY, Oh.
TA LO VILLAGER, 去射箭场。
KATY, What? Okay.
KATY," Um, looks like I’m gonna go deliver some dragon arrows."
SHANG-CHI," Oh, you’re gonna deliver some dragon arrows?"
KATY," Yeah. Make myself useful, you know."
KATY, Thank you.
YING NAN, Let’s go see your mother.
KATY," I just love how you guys know exactly what you wanna do, and you spend your whole life getting really good at it."
KATY, I wish I was more like that.
KATY," It’s like every time I get moderately good at something, I just quit and start something new."
KATY," But I just know my own limits, and I’m not gonna waste my time chasing something that will ultimately be a disappointment for me."
KATY, That’s not me.
TA LO VILLAGER, 光伯。
TA LO VILLAGER, 让她试试。
TA LO VILLAGER, 如果你心中没有靶子，就是无的放矢。
YING NAN, You were everything to her.
YING NAN, She knew that one day you would find your way here and asked me to prepare something for your arrival.
YING NAN," After losing someone like her, it’s easy to feel alone in this world."
YING NAN, But you’re not.
YING NAN," You are children of this family, and I welcome you home."
YING NAN, 这里不是你父亲的家。
YING NAN, 在大罗，每个人都可以练武。
YING NAN, 是时候从影子里走出来了，孩子。
KATY," Guang Bo, you saw that?"
KATY, That was tight!
SHANG-CHI, My mother was the only one who could beat him.
SHANG-CHI, Show me how she did it.
TREVOR," (WHISTLES) No, sorry."
TREVOR," Sorry. Offside, offside."
YING NAN, Your mother knew who she was.
YING NAN, Do you?
YING NAN, You are a product of all who came before you.
YING NAN," The legacy of your family, the good and the bad, it is all a part of who you are."
YING NAN," Stop hiding, nephew."
YING NAN, It only prolongs the pain.
LI, 我们很快就能团聚了。
RAZOR FIST, Sir.
RAZOR FIST, The men are ready.
WENWU, The passage will open at dawn.
RAZOR FIST, I’ll prepare the vehicles.
LI, 以心行气。
LI, 以气运身，要先掌握阴阳的转换。
LI, 你才能找到内心的平衡，从而真正认识自己。
GANG LEADER, 夫想灭了我的门。
GANG LEADER, 我们今天是来回礼的。
LI, 他已经不是以前的那个人了。
GANG LEADER, 那我不管。
LI, 你们之间的事情跟我的孩子们无关。
GANG LEADER, 放了他们可以，但这个礼必须有人来接吧。
LI, 夏灵。尚气。
LI, 进屋去。
LI, 我跟客人有话要说。
SHANG-CHI, 可是你现在没有魔法了呀。
LI, 尚气，别怕。
SHANG-CHI, 妈妈。
SHANG-CHI, 妈妈。
SHANG-CHI, 爸爸。
WENWU, 她说我是可以改变的。
WENWU, 我可以放下一切。
WENWU, 可是她错了。
WENWU, 如果我当初没有把它们摘下来，那些混蛋根本就不敢动手。
WENWU, 他们要付出代价。
WENWU, 你们老板呢？
MAN, 我不知道！
MAN, 我真的不知道！
WENWU, 那好。
WENWU, 血债必须要血偿。
WENWU, 你愿意帮爸爸吗？
WENWU, We found the man responsible for killing your mother.
WENWU, It is your right to finish this for both of us.
WENWU," And when you return, we will rebuild The Ten Rings to what it once was."
KATY, Been looking everywhere for ya.
KATY, You okay?
SHANG-CHI, I’m not who you think I am.
KATY, You already apologised for that. We’re good…
SHANG-CHI, That’s not what I’m talking about.
KATY, Okay.
KATY, What… What is it?
SHANG-CHI, When my dad sent me to find the man who killed my mom…
SHANG-CHI, I told you I couldn’t go through with it.
SHANG-CHI, I lied.
SHANG-CHI," I thought that I could change my name, start a new life, pretend like it never happened."
SHANG-CHI, But…
SHANG-CHI, She would hate the person I’ve become.
KATY, Your dad trained you to be an assassin when you were seven.
KATY, He sent you on a hit at 14.
KATY," You realise how messed up that is, right?"
SHANG-CHI, My mom is dead because of him.
SHANG-CHI, And now he’s coming to destroy her home.
SHANG-CHI, 血债必须要血偿。
KATY, What are you saying?
SHANG-CHI, I’m gonna do what he trained me to do.
SHANG-CHI, I’m gonna kill him.
XIALING, He’s here.
GUANG BO, 不行！
GUANG BO, 你还没准备好。
GUANG BO, 她留下来。
WENWU, Are you here to help the people holding your own mother captive?
YING NAN, She isn’t back there.
YING NAN, You’re being lied to by a creature who wants to destroy us all.
WENWU, Is that what they told you?
WENWU, I know my wife’s voice.
YING NAN," I miss my sister as much as you do, but this is not the way to honour her memory."
WENWU, Did you honour her when you turned her away from your gate?
GUANG BO, 混账。我们拒绝的人是你。
GUANG BO, 树去造的孽会毁了这个地方。
WENWU, 小子，跟我讲话礼貌点厂。
WENWU, 我吃的盐比你吃的饭还要多。
WENWU, Let me pass.
YING NAN, We cannot do that.
WENWU, Burn it down.
XIALING, Stop him!
WENWU, Are you planning to stop me all by yourself?
SHANG-CHI, I’m not afraid of you.
WENWU," Yes, you are."
WENWU, You’ve spent your entire life afraid.
WENWU," Always running, always hiding."
WENWU," You were there when they came for her, and you did nothing."
WENWU, You stood at a window and watched her die!
SHANG-CHI, She was gone and we needed you.
SHANG-CHI, But you chose those damn rings over us. (SNIFFLES)
SHANG-CHI, You trained your son to be a killer.
SHANG-CHI, Is this what you wanted?
SHANG-CHI," Even if you could bring her back,"
SHANG-CHI, what makes you think she’d want anything to do with you?
LI, 来救我。
LI, 快来救我。
LI, 救我。
WENWU, 我们回家。
YING NAN, He breached the gate!
XIALING, Those things are gonna kill us all if we don’t work together.
RAZOR FIST, You think I’m going to fall for that?
YING NAN, Your weapons are useless against them.
RAZOR FIST, We don’t need your help.
RAZOR FIST," We are the mighty Ten Rings, and any…"
RAZOR FIST, We… We should work together.
RAZOR FIST, Release them.
RAZOR FIST, Release them!
XIALING, What are they doing?
YING NAN, Stealing souls to feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.
YING NAN," If it grows strong enough, it will break right through the gate."
YING NAN, That was just the beginning.
TA LO VILLAGER, 太危险了。
KATY, I have to help my friends.
GUANG BO, 活着回来。
GUANG BO, 所有人马上到湖边集合。
RAZOR FIST, To the lake! Let’s go!
RAZOR FIST, Let’s go!
KATY," Hey, where’s your brother?"
XIALING, I was hoping you knew.
LI, 救我。
GUANG BO, 齐天共战，视死如归！
GUANG BO, 深吸一口气。
LI, 尚气别怕。
LI, 你有神龙之心。
LI, 你是妈妈的血脉。也是爸爸的。
LI, 你要把我们给你的一切化成你自己的力量。
LI, 你是妈妈的骄傲。
LI, 我们家需要你。
LI, 去吧。
GUANG BO, 开考。
GUANG BO, 放箭！
YING NAN, You have to stop your father!
SHANG-CHI," She’s not back there, Dad."
WENWU," Get out of my way, boy."
SHANG-CHI, No.
TREVOR," Calm down, mate."
TREVOR," I’m not dead, it’s just a performance."
TREVOR, Now get down here and play along.
WENWU, I have to save her.
WENWU, She’s calling to me.
SHANG-CHI, I wish that were true.
SHANG-CHI," Dad, please."
SHANG-CHI, Your family needs you.
LI, 放我出去！
SHANG-CHI, Shit.
SHANG-CHI, It’s headed for the village!
GUANG BO, 如果神龙龙的灵魂被吞掉了，
GUANG BO, 那就什么都阻止不了它了！
GUANG BO, 对准它的喉咙！
XIALING, 放手吧。
XIALING, 放手！
SHANG-CHI, I’m not leaving you again.
KATY, Holy shit.
XIALING, 去吧。
YING NAN," Tonight, we honour those who gave their lives so we might see another day."
YING NAN, They were more than warriors.
YING NAN," They were our mothers and fathers, our sisters and brothers."
YING NAN," And though we will always hold on to their memories, tonight we release them to rest with our ancestors."
SHANG-CHI, 爸，一路走好。
XIALING, 妈妈，放心吧。
YING NAN," A thousand years ago, and a thousand years from now, we will always be together."
KATY, I seriously thought we were going to die.
KATY," And I’d only learned how to shoot a bow, like, a day earlier, now I’m on a battlefield, killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun’s aunty, who’s this awesome, magical kung fu goddess."
SHANG-CHI," And I’m hanging on to The Great Protector with my sister at this point, trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker."
KATY," Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch."
SHANG-CHI, Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon’s soul.
KATY, Which would have allowed it to destroy the entire universe.
SHANG-CHI, Yeah.
KATY," I only had one arrow left, and all I could hear in the back of my mind was my mom’s voice saying, “Just take the shot, you little mooch!”"
KATY," And so, I aimed right for the Sucker’s throat and I let her fly."
SHANG-CHI, She hit it dead on.
KATY, And then Shaun used the Ten Rings to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball that exploded the thing…
KATY, …and he saved the world.
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, we, uh, lost some good people that day… but we made it."
SHANG-CHI, We made it.
SOO, Are you done mocking me?
KATY," Oh, no. We’re not mocking you."
SOO, So where is this sister of yours?
SHANG-CHI," She’s back at my dad’s compound, shutting down his operations."
KATY," Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings for the past thousand years."
SOO," Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips, and you want me to believe you’re now saving the world from soul-sucking monsters?"
SOO," I know, you’re trying to get me back for what I said last time, but I’m not gonna apologise…"
SOO, …for speaking the truth as a friend.
SOO," I really meant what I said, and, in fact, I actually think this whole bit you’re doing just further proves my point."
SOO, You guys are obviously…
SOO, What?
WONG, Shang-Chi.
WONG, Shang-Chi.
SHANG-CHI, Uh… Here.
SHANG-CHI, Present.
WONG, My name is Wong.
SHANG-CHI," Yeah, I know, sir. I’m a huge fan…"
WONG, Do you have the rings?
SHANG-CHI," Uh… Yeah, yes."
WONG," Good. Let’s go, we have a lot to talk about."
WONG, You too.
KATY, Me too?
SHANG-CHI, I think we should…
KATY, Yeah. (MUMBLES)
SHANG-CHI," Uh, we gotta go."
KATY, Yeah.
KATY," I know this is, like, crazy, but I’m gonna text you, and we’ll do this again. Nice to see you, John."
SHANG-CHI, I’ll Venmo you for the…
WONG, Hmm.
WONG, They don’t match any artefacts from our codex.
WONG, What do you think?
BRUCE," Mm, I’m not sure."
BRUCE, They’re not vibranium. Chitauri?
CAROL, Not like any alien tech I’ve seen.
CAROL, How long did your dad have them before he gave them to you?
SHANG-CHI, Um…
SHANG-CHI, About a thousand years.
BRUCE, Their thermoluminescence indicates they’re older than that.
BRUCE, By a lot.
WONG," The first time you used the rings, we felt it in Kamar-Taj."
KATY, What is it?
CAROL, A beacon.
BRUCE, They’re sending a message.
SHANG-CHI, A message to where?
CAROL, I’m so sorry. I have to deal with this.
CAROL, You can get my number from Bruce.
CAROL, It was so nice to meet you.
BRUCE," Yeah, I… I don’t have her number."
BRUCE, She… She does this a lot.
BRUCE," Guys, stay safe."
BRUCE, Welcome to the circus.
WONG," I know this is a lot to take in, but you’re gonna have to start getting used to that."
WONG," From now on, the trajectory of your lives will be like nothing you’ve ever experienced before."
WONG, And there’s no going back.
WONG, You both have a long journey ahead of you.
WONG," Go home, get some rest."
KATY, Yeah. That’s a good idea.
SHANG-CHI," Yeah. Yeah, we probably should do that."
SHANG-CHI, Or…
ALL, (SINGING) ♪ Welcome to the Hotel California ♪
RAZOR FIST, They’re waiting.
XIALING, Let’s get started.
XIALING, We have a lot of work to do.
