WOMAN: (IN MANDARIN) The legend of the ten rings has been told for thousands of years.

Every generation, the story grows.

But at its centre there is always one man.

(HORSE GRUNTS)

Some say he found the rings in a crater or stole them from a tomb.

They gave him the strength of a god, and the gift of eternal life.

(BREATHES SHAKILY)

He could have used them for good.

(ARROWS WHIZZING)

But all he wanted… was power.

They moved in the shadows…

Toppled governments…

And changed the course of history.

(MEN SCREAM)

He chased money and power for a thousand years.

But he still wanted more.

(IN MANDARIN) Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

A hidden village with mythical creatures and ancient magic.

Where people practise a martial arts style from the gods.

I want to find it.

Of course. I’ll send a scout to explore the area, and come back with more information.

I want to go now.

But love had other plans.

Shang-Chi, there’s much more to know about the legend of the rings, but you’ll learn about that when you’re older.

If Dad’s rings were so powerful, how did you beat him?

Where I’m from, we are empowered by the magic of the Great Protector.

When you have the heart of our dragon, you can do some amazing things.

Can you still do those things?

I left those powers in Ta Lo with our dragon, but what I got in return is so much better.

Hey, hey, get back here.

(SIGHS) Please open the door.

(ENGINE ROARS)

Oh, my God.

Get out.

You get in!

Look, if happens to this thing, we’re gonna be jobless and in debt for the rest of our lives.

Oh, come on. Nothing’s gonna happen to this car.

I’m the Asian Jeff Gordon.

I don’t know who that is.

Most career wins in all of NASCAR history?

Please get out of the car.

Shaun, we’ve been friends for 10 years, okay?

You know I’m not an idiot.

(SIGHS)

Please, get in. I’ll go slow.

(ENGINE REVVING)

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

(GIGGLES)

(GASPS) Katy, watch the…

(TYRES SCREECHING)

SHAUN: I knew Katy was trouble the first day we met in high school.

I was getting picked on a lot, for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot.

Plus, I had just moved to the US, so I was struggling with my English, and I was on my way to lunch one day when this guy who was like twice my size yells at me from down the hall, “What’s up, Gangnam Style?”

So I yelled back, “I’m not Korean, idiot.”

And I turn the corner, and I see this guy drop his backpack, he’s getting all up in his face…

And right before he was about to throw the first punch,

Katy comes out of nowhere, steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics to Hotel California.

What?

It’s the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people.

SHAUN: And that’s how we met.

Then I pulled him into the parking lot…

At which point she revealed that she had also swiped the keys to the guy’s Mustang.

Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block.

And your wife was in the car, too.

That’s true. You were.

What?

I was just in the back seat.

That’s a part of the car.

That’s still a part of the car.

How have you never told me this story?

You know, before she was a lawyer,

your girl was pretty wild.

Oh! What happened?

I grew up.

What’s that supposed to mean?

Yeah, what’s that supposed to mean?

That maybe there’s a point

where you’re supposed to stop going on joyrides and start thinking about living up to your potential.

Please tell me you’re kidding, Soo.

SOO: Look, we’re now living in a world where at any moment half the population can just disappear.

Life’s too short and too fragile.

Katy, you’re a valet driver with an honours degree from Berkeley, and Shaun can speak, like, four languages.

You’ve always been the most talented people I know.

I just don’t get why you’re scared

to actually use it for something serious.

Wow.

You sound like my mom. You also… dress like her a little bit, too.

Where’s this from, Talbots?

(SOO LAUGHS)

We’re not running from adulthood.

How is it running to have jobs that you actually like?

Yeah, that doesn’t even make any sense.

(FUMBLES) Did you think valet parking is easy?

It’s like the most challenging job ever.

You need people skills, driving skills…

KATY: Soo can’t even parallel park.

(SHAUN LAUGHS)

(EXHALES HEAVILY)

Well, it’s almost midnight. We got the early shift.

Should probably be responsible, go to sleep.

Yeah, we can be responsible. We can do that.

Morning, Mrs Chen.

She’s not ready yet.

Come have some joe while you wait.

Katy, Shaun’s here.

Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute.

Ruihua, you’re supposed to be helping your dad stock the shop.

Mom, I can’t work on an empty stomach, my legs get crampy.

Maybe Shaun can help him instead of just showing up every day to eat our food.

I’m happy to help.

No, it’s Ruihua’s job, let him do it.

Waipo.

(IN MANDARIN) That seat’s for Waigong.

(IN ENGLISH) Oh, sorry.

He’s getting all his favourite things this year for the Day of the Dead.

(IN ENGLISH) Are you sure that Waigong’s allowed to take

Funyuns and cigarettes back to the afterlife?

He can take anything.

Last year I put a bottle of whisky on his grave…

And it was gone the next morning.

(SHAUN CHUCKLES)

I know you kids think it’s silly.

(IN ENGLISH) We don’t think it’s silly, Waipo.

We just know Waigong would’ve wanted you to move on and enjoy your life.

“Moving on” is an American idea.

You’re American, Mom! Don’t forget.

MRS CHEN: Shaun, did my daughter apply to any new jobs this week?

She really likes her job.

We both do.

KATY: Mm-hmm.

Waigong didn’t move here from Hunan so you could park cars for a living.

Well, on that note, I think we’re gonna miss our bus.

SHAUN: Mm.

KATY: I’m sorry for my unacceptable job.

And for staying out late last night, trying to enjoy my life.

But one day, I’ll make you proud, I promise.

I’m proud of you, sis.

Parking cars is super hard.

Thanks, bro.

Maybe one day you’ll pass your driver’s test, live the dream like me.

Come on, Shaun, let’s go.

She’s writing a research paper on a bus.

That is exactly the daughter my mom wishes came out of her vagina.

I’m sorry about her.

You have a sister?

Look, I know this is confusing.

I’ll explain it when I get back, I promise.

No, no.

Hell no, dude.

This is bullshit!

I have been by your side for half your life.

I get there are things you never wanted to talk about, and I never wanted to push.

But a guy with a freaking machete for an arm just chopped our bus in half, Shaun!

Who the hell are you?

(SIGHS)

My sister sent me this a few months ago.

I think it’s the address of where she’s staying.

Those guys back there were sent by my dad.

What?

If they hurt her…

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Beef or vegetarian?

We’re all out of the chicken, so I can only offer you beef or vegetarian?

Vegetarian would be great.

Yeah, same.

You’re going into hiding.

Okay.

That was really cool.

I like your pants.

What do you want?

The Ten Rings ambushed us in San Francisco.

XIALING: I saw the video.

They took my pendant.

They’re gonna come for yours next.

I don’t know what he wants with them, but we both know it can’t be good.

You know what he said to me when he left?

“I’ll be back in three days.”

And after three days, I went to our mom’s shrine and waited.

Three days turned into a week, a week turned to a month, and a month turned to six years.

That’s how long it took me to realise I didn’t need him any more.

I built this place on my own.

I didn’t need you then, and I don’t need you now.

Then why would you send me the postcard?

Just nod. Don’t talk. He’ll forget you’re there.

That’s how I survived.

He always treat you like that?

Only after my mom died.

He said he couldn’t look at me because I reminded him of her.

I wasn’t allowed to train with the boys.

But I watched everything they did and taught myself to do it better.

When did you leave?

I ran away when I was 16.

As soon as I knew my brother wasn’t coming back.

You started an underground fight ring in Macau when you were 16 years old?

If my dad won’t let me into his empire, I’m gonna build my own.

I gave you 10 years to live your life, and where did it get you?

(SHANG-CHI SIGHS)

Now it’s time for you to take your place by my side.

That’s not gonna happen.

MAN: American girl.

Her name is Katy.

What is your Chinese name?

Ruiwen.

Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

They connect us not only to ourselves, but to everyone who came before.

A funny story.

Some years ago, a terrorist from America needed a boogeyman to bring your country to its knees.

So, he appropriated The Ten Rings.

My Ten Rings.

But because he didn’t know my actual name, he invented a new one.

Do you know the name he chose?

The Mandarin.

He gave his figurehead the name of a chicken dish.

And it worked.

America was terrified.

Of an orange.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

The truth is, I’ve had many names throughout my life.

The Warrior King, Master Khan, the most dangerous man on Earth.

For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be.

But when I met their mother, everything changed.

(SOFT TRADITIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

She showed me a part of myself I didn’t know was there.

It was like I was seeing the world for the first time.

(CONVERSING IN MANDARIN)

She gave up everything so we could be together.

And so did I.

(LI GIGGLES)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

(IN MANDARIN) You know who’s in there?

Say, “Hello, little sister!”

(LI GIGGLES)

MANDARIN: After all those years, I finally found something worth growing old for.

My real name is Wenwu.

She was the only one who called me that.

And when she died… I was lost for many years.

But I’m not lost any more.

When you children ran away, I was so desperate to connect with your mother, I threw myself back into the studies of her village.

The legendary Ta Lo.

I wasn’t able to find the secret path to the village entrance, but I did find what they are hiding.

There’s a gate deep in their mountains.

Your mother is waiting for us there.

I know this is a lot.

I might not have believed it if she didn’t tell me herself.

What are you talking about?

I was sitting right here in this seat, deep in my research… and she spoke to me.

It was like she was standing in this room.

I could feel her breath on my cheek and her hand on my back.

She told me she needs my help.

To do what?

To save her from her people.

After we fell in love, your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo.

She asked permission from the elders, and they refused.

They said I wasn’t worthy.

She would still be with us.

We would all be living there together.

Ta Lo did this to us.

They locked her behind that gate to punish her.

Don’t you see?

She’s leaving clues for us.

She wants us to find her and bring her home, so we can be a family again.

Dad, Mom’s gone.

She’s not talking to you from behind a gate, and she’s not leaving any clues for us.

Then what are these?

(MYSTICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(SOFT WHOOSHING)

The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze.

But there’s a direct path through the forest that only opens once a year on Qingming Jie.

To get through, you need to know the route and the exact time it opens.

Now I know both.

Three days from now, we will rescue my wife from her prison and bring her home.

(ALL RESPOND IN MANDARIN)

This is why you’re here.

To help me bring her back to us.

And what happens if they don’t let you open the gate?

We’ll burn the village to the ground.

What?

You can’t just march into our mom’s village with this bullshit.

I mean, do you have any idea how insane…

(SHANG-CHI GRUNTING)

(GASPS)

Hey!

(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

Where are you taking me?

(IN MANDARIN) When will you stop pretending?

(IN ENGLISH) Lock them up.

LI: (IN MANDARIN) It’s okay, my dear.

We’re all going to be together soon.

(IN ENGLISH) So, um, pretty confused right now, because, uh, initially I thought your dad should definitely see a therapist for his delusions, but then that dragon vomited a magical water map, and now I have no idea what’s real.

Is what he said about your mom’s village true?

(SIGHS)

She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo when we were kids.

A village in another dimension full of magical creatures.

I thought it was just a fairy tale.

What if Dad’s right?

About Mom being locked behind a gate by her own people?

Crazier things have turned out to be true.

Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but if we don’t find a way to get to Ta Lo before him, he’s gonna destroy everything that’s left of our family.

This family was destroyed a long time ago.

(MUFFLED MAN GROANING)

The hell was that?

(GROANING AND GIBBERING)

Oh.

(FUMBLES) You’re going toward that noise?

(MAN CONTINUES GROANING AND GIBBERING)

(METAL STRIKING)

“Wake Duncan with thy knocking.

“Oh, I would’st though could’st.

“My deed ’twere best not…”

Oh, hello, loves.

What year is it?

Who are you?

Trevor? Slattery?

The actor from Liverpool?

Wait.

Are you the governor’s kids?

I’ve been preparing a monologue for your homecoming dinner.

Oh. Where’s she going?

Why are you down here?

Well, some time ago, I was offered the role of a terrorist.

I know, facile, trite, I couldn’t agree more.

But times were lean, you know what I mean?

Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC.

But, ironic twist, it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist, and I wasn’t playing a character at all, but what I now recognise to be a rather unflattering portrait of your father.

We all got our just deserts.

The producer got blown up by Iron Man, and I served time in federal prison, which turned out to be the best thing for me.

I got clean, I rediscovered my passion.

Then my dad broke you out?

Exactly.

To kill you.

Exactly.

But just as his men were tying me up for my execution, I launched into a performance of my Macbeth.

“Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would’st though could’st…”

They couldn’t get enough of it.

I’ve been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since.

So you’re like his jester?

I can give you a quick preview if you like.

“Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle…”

Uh, thank you, Trevor. I think we’re okay.

Right now, we really just need to find a way to…

(CREATURE PURRING)

KATY: Morris?

(LAUGHS) Oh, Morris!

All this time I thought I was hallucinating him.

Oh, this is such fab news.

Where’s his face?

(MORRIS GROWLS)

(SHUSHING)

He’s a bit sensitive about that.

(MORRIS CHITTERING)

Oh. Really?

Morris says he knows who you are.

It talks… It talks to you?

(CHUCKLES) If he didn’t talk to me, I’d have gone mad yonks ago.

SHANG-CHI: How would he know me?

He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo.

Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest on one of his expeditions to find the entrance.

(MORRIS PURRING AND COOING)

He wants you to take him home.

(MORRIS COOING)

Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how.

According to my dad, the path there only opens once a year.

(MORRIS CHITTERING)

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

(CONTINUES CHITTERING)

Morris says he can guide you there right now.

You can get through the maze without waiting for the path to open.

But, and it’s a big “but,” it’s very dangerous.

How dangerous?

No one’s ever made it out alive.

But Morris is 90% confident he can guide us through safely.

(MORRIS SQUEALS)

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

19%.

Look, I’ve done dumber things with worse odds.

But even if that chicken-pig is right…

(MORRIS WHINES)

(CRASHING)

(DOOR OPENS)

They will come back once I bring her home.

Prepare the men for war.

Yes, sir.

TREVOR: The first time I witnessed pure artistry.

1968. Planet of the Apes.

I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum, watching mastery unfold before my very eyes.

After the film, I asked her, “How did they get those monkeys to do those things?”

And she patted me on the head and she said, “It’s not real, pet. It’s just acting.”

That’s when I knew.

If they can teach those monkeys to act that brilliantly, just imagine what I could bring to the world.

So you became an actor because you thought the monkeys were actually…

Riding horses? I did. Yes.

When, in fact, they were simply acting as if they were riding horses.

I still can’t get my head round it, to be honest.

Good for you, dude.

You found your passion and went for it, and eventually used it to cripple the US government, but whatever.

TREVOR: Yeah. No, yeah, thanks.

Um, this is really cool and all, but how long do we have to sit here?

Morris is very clear.

The way through is all about timing.

Okay, but how long are we talking?

Like, hours? Days?

Friends, I am but a transitory vessel for the infinite wisdom of a creature far more advanced than we’ll ever truly understand.

What he sees, what he feels of this vast, unknown universe is beyond anything our simple brains can…

(MORRIS SQUAWKS)

Oh. You can go.

What?

Go. You can go. He says “go.”

(SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

He says it eats us. Go left.

(SHANG-CHI GASPS)

SHANG-CHI: Watch your back!

Stay in the pocket.

KATY: How close is it?

Five metres.

TREVOR: Stay in the pocket.

Really fricking close.

I’m your aunty Nan.

You look like your mother.

(IN ENGLISH) Hi, I’m Katy.

YING NAN: Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

Oh, thank you.

(MORRIS PANTING EXCITEDLY)

(LAUGHS)

YING NAN: Look who has found his way home! (CHUCKLES)

I’m not a threat.

Just an entertainer.

Morris can vouch for me.

We don’t have much time.

Our father is coming.

(SIGHS SOFTLY)

(VILLAGERS CHATTERING)

YING NAN: Our people have been here for over 4,000 years, preparing for something we hope will never happen.

We are the keepers of the Dark Gate, sworn to protect this realm and yours from the evil that’s locked behind it.

SHANG-CHI: Our dad is coming here to open that gate.

He thinks you’re holding our mom there.

Why would he think that?

XIALING: She told him.

He says he can hear her asking for help.

Is he wearing the rings?

SHANG-CHI: He hasn’t taken them off since she died.

What do they have to do with all this?

YING NAN: The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond the shores of our small village.

We have cities that surpass any in your universe, rich with culture and history.

Thousands of years ago, all of our people lived in peace and prosperity, until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

He came with his army, devouring every soul in their path, and with each kill, they grew stronger.

After decimating our largest cities, they were headed to your universe to do the same.

The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here to stop them from reaching the portal to your world.

But our ancestors were no match for them.

Until The Great Protector joined their fight and turned the tide.

Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army into the Dark Gate and locked it behind them.

Our people have guarded that gate ever since, empowered by the magic of The Great Protector and the gift that she gave us.

(WEAPON POWERS UP)

(KATY GASPS)

Dragon scales.

Makes very good armour.

Your father isn’t the first to come here to open the Dark Gate.

Many have tried and failed over the centuries, and they all had one thing in common.

They were lured here by the voice of something on the other side.

A voice that promised them their greatest desires.

So you think soul eaters are talking to our dad?

They know The Ten Rings have the power to break them free.

(KATY GASPS)

Oh.

Here you go.

Oh.

(IN MANDARIN) To the range.

(IN ENGLISH) What? Okay.

Um, looks like I’m gonna go deliver some dragon arrows.

Oh, you’re gonna deliver some dragon arrows?

KATY: Yeah. Make myself useful, you know.

Thank you.

Let’s go see your mother.

(MORRIS BABBLING)

(MORRIS YELPS)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

I just love how you guys know exactly what you wanna do, and you spend your whole life getting really good at it.

I wish I was more like that.

It’s like every time I get moderately good at something, I just quit and start something new.

But I just know my own limits, and I’m not gonna waste my time chasing something that will ultimately be a disappointment for me.

That’s not me.

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

Guang Bo.

Let her shoot.

If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing.

(SOFT FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)

YING NAN: (IN ENGLISH) You were everything to her.

She knew that one day you would find your way here and asked me to prepare something for your arrival.

(MUSIC SWELLING)

After losing someone like her, it’s easy to feel alone in this world.

But you’re not.

You are children of this family, and I welcome you home.

(SHANG-CHI SIGHS)

YING NAN: (IN ENGLISH) Tonight, we honour those who gave their lives so we might see another day.

They were more than warriors.

They were our mothers and fathers, our sisters and brothers.

And though we will always hold on to their memories, tonight we release them to rest with our ancestors.

SHANG-CHI: (IN MANDARIN) Farewell, Dad.

XIALING: Mum, we’ll be okay.

YING NAN: (IN ENGLISH) A thousand years ago, and a thousand years from now, we will always be together.

(MUSIC SWELLING)

KATY: I seriously thought we were going to die.

And I’d only learned how to shoot a bow, like, a day earlier, now I’m on a battlefield, killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun’s aunty, who’s this awesome, magical kung fu goddess.

And I’m hanging on to The Great Protector with my sister at this point, trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker.

Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch.

SHANG-CHI: Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon’s soul.

KATY: Which would have allowed it to destroy the entire universe.

SHANG-CHI: Yeah.

KATY: I only had one arrow left, and all I could hear in the back of my mind was my mom’s voice saying, “Just take the shot, you little mooch!”

And so, I aimed right for the Sucker’s throat and I let her fly.

She hit it dead on.

And then Shaun used the Ten Rings to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball that exploded the thing…

(MOUTHING)

…and he saved the world.

Yeah, we, uh, lost some good people that day… but we made it.

We made it.

Are you done mocking me?

Oh, no. We’re not mocking you.

So where is this sister of yours?

She’s back at my dad’s compound, shutting down his operations.

Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings for the past thousand years.

Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips, and you want me to believe you’re now saving the world from soul-sucking monsters?

I know, you’re trying to get me back for what I said last time, but I’m not gonna apologise…

(CRACKLING)

…for speaking the truth as a friend.

I really meant what I said, and, in fact, I actually think this whole bit you’re doing just further proves my point.

You guys are obviously…

(CRACKLING CONTINUES)

What?

MAN: Shang-Chi.

Shang-Chi.

Uh… Here.

Present.

(CHAIRS SCRAPE)

My name is Wong.

Yeah, I know, sir. I’m a huge fan…

Do you have the rings?

SHANG-CHI: Uh… Yeah, yes.

Good. Let’s go, we have a lot to talk about.

You too.

(WONG EXHALES LOUDLY)

Me too?

I think we should…

Yeah. (MUMBLES)

SHANG-CHI: Uh, we gotta go.

KATY: Yeah.

I know this is, like, crazy, but I’m gonna text you, and we’ll do this again. Nice to see you, John.

I’ll Venmo you for the…

(RINGS HUMMING)

WONG: Hmm.

They don’t match any artefacts from our codex.

What do you think?

BRUCE: Mm, I’m not sure.

They’re not vibranium. Chitauri?

Not like any alien tech I’ve seen.

How long did your dad have them before he gave them to you?

Um…

About a thousand years.

Their thermoluminescence indicates they’re older than that.

By a lot.

The first time you used the rings, we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

What is it?

CAROL: A beacon.

BRUCE: They’re sending a message.

A message to where?

(BEEPING)

(BEEPING STOPS)

I’m so sorry. I have to deal with this.

You can get my number from Bruce.

It was so nice to meet you.

Yeah, I… I don’t have her number.

She… She does this a lot.

Guys, stay safe.

Welcome to the circus.

I know this is a lot to take in, but you’re gonna have to start getting used to that.

From now on, the trajectory of your lives will be like nothing you’ve ever experienced before.

And there’s no going back.

You both have a long journey ahead of you.

Go home, get some rest.

Yeah. That’s a good idea.

Yeah. Yeah, we probably should do that.
