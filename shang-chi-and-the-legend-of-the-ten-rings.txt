SHAUN: I knew Katy was trouble the first day we met in high school.

SHAUN: I was getting picked on a lot, for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot.

SHAUN: Plus, I had just moved to the US, so I was struggling with my English, and I was on my way to lunch one day when this guy who was like twice my size yells at me from down the hall, “What’s up, Gangnam Style?”

SHAUN: So I yelled back, “I’m not Korean, idiot.”

KATY: And I turn the corner, and I see this guy drop his backpack, he’s getting all up in his face…

SHAUN: And right before he was about to throw the first punch,

SHAUN: Katy comes out of nowhere, steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics to Hotel California.

JOHN: What?

KATY: It’s the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people.

SHAUN: And that’s how we met.

KATY: Then I pulled him into the parking lot…

SHAUN: At which point she revealed that she had also swiped the keys to the guy’s Mustang.

KATY: Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block.

KATY: And your wife was in the car, too.

SHAUN: That’s true. You were.

JOHN: What?

KATY: That’s a part of the car.

JOHN: How have you never told me this story?

KATY: You know, before she was a lawyer,

KATY: your girl was pretty wild.

JOHN: Oh! What happened?

SOO: I grew up.

KATY: What’s that supposed to mean?

SHAUN: Yeah, what’s that supposed to mean?

SOO: That maybe there’s a point

SOO: where you’re supposed to stop going on joyrides and start thinking about living up to your potential.

KATY: Please tell me you’re kidding, Soo.

SOO: Look, we’re now living in a world where at any moment half the population can just disappear.

SOO: Life’s too short and too fragile.

SOO: Katy, you’re a valet driver with an honours degree from Berkeley, and Shaun can speak, like, four languages.

SOO: You’ve always been the most talented people I know.

WENWU: My son is home.

WENWU: Take the girls to their room.

KATY: I’ve seen some really scary stuff this week, but your dad’s on, like, a whole ‘nother level.

KATY: Is he gonna kill us?

XIALING: Just nod. Don’t talk. He’ll forget you’re there.

XIALING: That’s how I survived.

KATY: He always treat you like that?

XIALING: Only after my mom died.

XIALING: He said he couldn’t look at me because I reminded him of her.

XIALING: I wasn’t allowed to train with the boys.

XIALING: But I watched everything they did and taught myself to do it better.

KATY: When did you leave?

XIALING: I ran away when I was 16.

XIALING: As soon as I knew my brother wasn’t coming back.

KATY: You started an underground fight ring in Macau when you were 16 years old?

XIALING: If my dad won’t let me into his empire, I’m gonna build my own.

KATY: Hell yeah.

SHANG-CHI: How did you find me?

WENWU: I always know where my children are.

WENWU: I gave you 10 years to live your life, and where did it get you?

(SHANG-CHI SIGHS)

WENWU: Now it’s time for you to take your place by my side.

SHANG-CHI: That’s not gonna happen.

WENWU: American girl.

SHANG-CHI: Her name is Katy.

WENWU: What is your Chinese name?

KATY: Ruiwen.

WENWU: Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

WENWU: They connect us not only to ourselves, but to everyone who came before.

WENWU: A funny story.

WENWU: Some years ago, a terrorist from America needed a boogeyman to bring your country to its knees.

WENWU: So, he appropriated The Ten Rings.

WENWU: My Ten Rings.

WENWU: But because he didn’t know my actual name, he invented a new one.

WENWU: Do you know the name he chose?

WENWU: The Mandarin.

WENWU: He gave his figurehead the name of a chicken dish.

WENWU: And it worked.

WENWU: America was terrified.

WENWU: Of an orange.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

WENWU: The truth is, I’ve had many names throughout my life.

WENWU: The Warrior King, Master Khan, the most dangerous man on Earth.

WENWU: For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be.

WENWU: But when I met their mother, everything changed.

(SOFT TRADITIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

WENWU: She showed me a part of myself I didn’t know was there.

WENWU: It was like I was seeing the world for the first time.

(CONVERSING IN MANDARIN)

WENWU: And so did I.

WENWU: After all those years, I finally found something worth growing old for.

WENWU: My real name is Wenwu.

WENWU: She was the only one who called me that.

WENWU: And when she died… I was lost for many years.

WENWU: But I’m not lost any more.

WENWU: When you children ran away, I was so desperate to connect with your mother, I threw myself back into the studies of her village.

WENWU: The legendary Ta Lo.

WENWU: I wasn’t able to find the secret path to the village entrance, but I did find what they are hiding.

WENWU: There’s a gate deep in their mountains.

WENWU: Your mother is waiting for us there.

WENWU: I know this is a lot.

WENWU: I might not have believed it if she didn’t tell me herself.

XIALING: What are you talking about?

WENWU: I was sitting right here in this seat, deep in my research… and she spoke to me.

WENWU: It was like she was standing in this room.

WENWU: I could feel her breath on my cheek and her hand on my back.

WENWU: She told me she needs my help.

SHANG-CHI: To do what?

WENWU: To save her from her people.

WENWU: After we fell in love, your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo.

WENWU: She asked permission from the elders, and they refused.

WENWU: They said I wasn’t worthy.

WENWU: She would still be with us.

WENWU: We would all be living there together.

WENWU: Ta Lo did this to us.

WENWU: They locked her behind that gate to punish her.

WENWU: Don’t you see?

WENWU: She’s leaving clues for us.

WENWU: She wants us to find her and bring her home, so we can be a family again.

SHANG-CHI: Dad, Mom’s gone.

SHANG-CHI: She’s not talking to you from behind a gate, and she’s not leaving any clues for us.

WENWU: Then what are these?

(MYSTICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(SOFT WHOOSHING)

WENWU: The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze.

WENWU: But there’s a direct path through the forest that only opens once a year on Qingming Jie.

WENWU: To get through, you need to know the route and the exact time it opens.

WENWU: Now I know both.

WENWU: Three days from now, we will rescue my wife from her prison and bring her home.

(ALL RESPOND IN MANDARIN)

WENWU: This is why you’re here.

WENWU: To help me bring her back to us.

XIALING: And what happens if they don’t let you open the gate?

WENWU: We’ll burn the village to the ground.

SHANG-CHI: What?

SHANG-CHI: You can’t just march into our mom’s village with this bullshit.

SHANG-CHI: I mean, do you have any idea how insane…

(SHANG-CHI GRUNTING)

(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

KATY:Where are you taking me?

WENWU: 你还要装多久？

WENWU: Lock them up.

LI: 没关系。

LI: 咱们一家人很快就能在一起了。

KATY: So, um, pretty confused right now, because, uh, initially I thought your dad should definitely see a therapist for his delusions, but then that dragon vomited a magical water map, and now I have no idea what’s real.

KATY: Is what he said about your mom’s village true?

(SIGHS)

SHANG-CHI: She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo when we were kids.

SHANG-CHI: A village in another dimension full of magical creatures.

SHANG-CHI: I thought it was just a fairy tale.

XIALING: What if Dad’s right?

SHANG-CHI: About Mom being locked behind a gate by her own people?

XIALING: Crazier things have turned out to be true.

SHANG-CHI: Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but if we don’t find a way to get to Ta Lo before him, he’s gonna destroy everything that’s left of our family.

XIALING: This family was destroyed a long time ago.

(MUFFLED MAN GROANING)

TREVOR: What year is it?

KATY: Who are you?

TREVOR: Trevor? Slattery?

TREVOR: The actor from Liverpool?

TREVOR: Wait.

TREVOR: Are you the governor’s kids?

TREVOR: I’ve been preparing a monologue for your homecoming dinner.

TREVOR: Oh. Where’s she going?

KATY: Why are you down here?

TREVOR: Well, some time ago, I was offered the role of a terrorist.

TREVOR: I know, facile, trite, I couldn’t agree more.

TREVOR: But times were lean, you know what I mean?

TREVOR: Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC.

TREVOR: But, ironic twist, it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist, and I wasn’t playing a character at all, but what I now recognise to be a rather unflattering portrait of your father.

TREVOR: We all got our just deserts.

TREVOR: The producer got blown up by Iron Man, and I served time in federal prison, which turned out to be the best thing for me.

TREVOR: I got clean, I rediscovered my passion.

SHANG-CHI: Then my dad broke you out?

TREVOR: Exactly.

SHANG-CHI: To kill you.

TREVOR: Exactly.

TREVOR: But just as his men were tying me up for my execution, I launched into a performance of my Macbeth.

TREVOR: “Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would’st though could’st…”

TREVOR: They couldn’t get enough of it.

TREVOR: I’ve been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since.

KATY: So you’re like his jester?

TREVOR: I can give you a quick preview if you like.

TREVOR: “Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle…”

SHANG-CHI: Uh, thank you, Trevor. I think we’re okay.

SHANG-CHI: Right now, we really just need to find a way to…

TREVOR: Oh, this is such fab news.

KATY: Where’s his face?

(MORRIS GROWLS)

TREVOR: He’s a bit sensitive about that.

(MORRIS CHITTERING)

TREVOR: Oh. Really?

TREVOR: Morris says he knows who you are.

KATY: It talks… It talks to you?

TREVOR: (CHUCKLES) If he didn’t talk to me, I’d have gone mad yonks ago.

SHANG-CHI: How would he know me?

TREVOR: He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo.

TREVOR: Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest on one of his expeditions to find the entrance.

(MORRIS PURRING AND COOING)

TREVOR: He wants you to take him home.

(MORRIS COOING)

SHANG-CHI: Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how.

SHANG-CHI: According to my dad, the path there only opens once a year.

(MORRIS CHITTERING)

TREVOR: Oh. (CHUCKLES)

(CONTINUES CHITTERING)

TREVOR: Morris says he can guide you there right now.

TREVOR: You can get through the maze without waiting for the path to open.

TREVOR: But, and it’s a big “but,” it’s very dangerous.

KATY: How dangerous?

TREVOR: No one’s ever made it out alive.

TREVOR: But Morris is 90% confident he can guide us through safely.

(MORRIS SQUEALS)

TREVOR: Oh. (CHUCKLES)

TREVOR: 19%.

RAZOR FIST: Yes, sir.

TREVOR: The first time I witnessed pure artistry.

TREVOR: 1968. Planet of the Apes.

TREVOR: I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum, watching mastery unfold before my very eyes.

TREVOR: After the film, I asked her, “How did they get those monkeys to do those things?”

TREVOR: And she patted me on the head and she said, “It’s not real, pet. It’s just acting.”

TREVOR: That’s when I knew.

TREVOR: If they can teach those monkeys to act that brilliantly, just imagine what I could bring to the world.

SHANG-CHI: So you became an actor because you thought the monkeys were actually…

TREVOR: Riding horses? I did. Yes.

TREVOR: When, in fact, they were simply acting as if they were riding horses.

TREVOR: I still can’t get my head round it, to be honest.

KATY: Good for you, dude.

KATY: You found your passion and went for it, and eventually used it to cripple the US government, but whatever.

TREVOR: Yeah. No, yeah, thanks.

SHANG-CHI: Um, this is really cool and all, but how long do we have to sit here?

TREVOR: Morris is very clear.

TREVOR: The way through is all about timing.

SHANG-CHI: Okay, but how long are we talking?

SHANG-CHI: Like, hours? Days?

TREVOR: Friends, I am but a transitory vessel for the infinite wisdom of a creature far more advanced than we’ll ever truly understand.

YING NAN: We are the keepers of the Dark Gate, sworn to protect this realm and yours from the evil that’s locked behind it.

SHANG-CHI: Our dad is coming here to open that gate.

SHANG-CHI: He thinks you’re holding our mom there.

YING NAN: Why would he think that?

YING NAN: Is he wearing the rings?

SHANG-CHI: He hasn’t taken them off since she died.

SHANG-CHI: What do they have to do with all this?

YING NAN: The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond the shores of our small village.

YING NAN: We have cities that surpass any in your universe, rich with culture and history.

YING NAN: Thousands of years ago, all of our people lived in peace and prosperity, until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

YING NAN: He came with his army, devouring every soul in their path, and with each kill, they grew stronger.

YING NAN: After decimating our largest cities, they were headed to your universe to do the same.

YING NAN: The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here to stop them from reaching the portal to your world.

YING NAN: But our ancestors were no match for them.

YING NAN: Until The Great Protector joined their fight and turned the tide.

YING NAN: Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army into the Dark Gate and locked it behind them.

YING NAN: Our people have guarded that gate ever since, empowered by the magic of The Great Protector and the gift that she gave us.

(WEAPON POWERS UP)

YING NAN: Makes very good armour.

YING NAN: Your father isn’t the first to come here to open the Dark Gate.

YING NAN: They were lured here by the voice of something on the other side.

YING NAN: A voice that promised them their greatest desires.

KATY: I seriously thought we were going to die.

KATY: And I’d only learned how to shoot a bow, like, a day earlier, now I’m on a battlefield, killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun’s aunty, who’s this awesome, magical kung fu goddess.

SHANG-CHI: And I’m hanging on to The Great Protector with my sister at this point, trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker.

KATY: Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch.

SHANG-CHI: Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon’s soul.

KATY: Which would have allowed it to destroy the entire universe.

SHANG-CHI: Yeah.

KATY: I only had one arrow left, and all I could hear in the back of my mind was my mom’s voice saying, “Just take the shot, you little mooch!”

KATY: And so, I aimed right for the Sucker’s throat and I let her fly.

SHANG-CHI: She hit it dead on.

KATY: And then Shaun used the Ten Rings to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball that exploded the thing…

(MOUTHING)

KATY: …and he saved the world.

SHANG-CHI: Yeah, we, uh, lost some good people that day… but we made it.

SHANG-CHI: We made it.

SOO: So where is this sister of yours?

SHANG-CHI: She’s back at my dad’s compound, shutting down his operations.

KATY: Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings for the past thousand years.

SOO: Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips, and you want me to believe you’re now saving the world from soul-sucking monsters?

SOO: I know, you’re trying to get me back for what I said last time, but I’m not gonna apologise…

(CRACKLING)
